# RAG System Learning Evolution: Multi-platform Database


## Overview


This document records the continuous evolution of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for the `joaocastanheira_bancodedados` database documentation. It serves as a learning log that captures difficult questions, knowledge gaps, implemented improvements, and insights discovered during system usage.


The goal is to create a feedback loop that allows for continuous improvement of:
1. The documentation itself (content, structure, organization)
2. The chunking and embedding strategy
3. The quality of generated responses
4. The coverage of topics and use cases


This record evolves organically over time, becoming increasingly valuable as more interactions occur and more patterns emerge.

## Challenging Questions and Identified Gaps


### Questions the RAG System Struggled to Answer


This section documents questions for which the RAG system could not provide satisfactory answers, along with root cause analyses and corrective actions taken.


|Date|User Question|Identified Problem|Implemented Solution|Status|
|------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|--------|
|YYYY-MM-DD|"How to track partially refunded transactions in the system?"|Insufficient documentation about partial refunds; chunks did not contain specific information about this use case|Added specific example in `Process_Flow_Refund_Chargeback.md` and expanded query in `Analytics_Examples.md` to include partial refund analysis|Resolved|
|YYYY-MM-DD|"What is the best way to model offers with variable trial periods?"|Lacked detailed information about trial period implementation across different plans|Expanded documentation in `Domain_Products_Catalog.md` with specific section on trial period implementation|Resolved|
|YYYY-MM-DD|"How does the system handle price changes for active subscriptions?"|Incomplete documentation on the plan and price update process|Under analysis|Pending|


(Ref: RAG System Learning Evolution, ID system_learning_evolution_001)


### Identified Knowledge Gaps


Areas of the domain that were identified as insufficiently documented or that need to be expanded to answer user queries.


|Date|Identified Gap|Impact|Action Plan|Status|
|------|---------------------|---------|---------------|--------|
|YYYY-MM-DD|Missing details about the plan migration process|Users cannot understand how to implement plan changes that preserve history|Create dedicated document `Process_Flow_Plan_Changes.md`|Planned|
|YYYY-MM-DD|Limited documentation on integration with invoice issuing systems|Difficult to understand how transaction data connects to fiscal systems|Expand `platform_software_invoice_history` in relevant documents|Pending|
|YYYY-MM-DD|Missing query examples for time-series trend analysis|Users struggle to create time-series dashboards|Add section in `Analytics_Examples.md`|Pending|


(Ref: RAG System Learning Evolution, ID system_learning_evolution_001)


## Documentation Improvements Implemented


### Content Expansions


New documents or significant sections added to fill identified gaps.


|Date|Document|Implemented Improvement|Motivator|
|------|-----------|------------------------|-----------| 
|YYYY-MM-DD|`Process_Flow_Revenue_Recognition.md`|New document detailing how to recognize revenue in the accounting context|Frequent questions from finance teams|
|YYYY-MM-DD|`Domain_Transactions_Lifecycle.md`|Added section on bank reconciliation and payment validation|Feedback from operations team|
|YYYY-MM-DD|`Analytics_Examples.md`|Expanded churn section with predictive analysis|Need identified by data team|


(Ref: RAG System Learning Evolution, ID system_learning_evolution_001)


### RAG Strategy Refinements


Technical improvements to documentation structure, chunking, embeddings, or retrieval process.


|Date|Improvement Type|Description|Observed Result|
|------|------------------|-----------|---------------------|
|YYYY-MM-DD|Chunking|Reduced average chunk size in process documents to improve retrieval granularity|15% improvement in answer accuracy for specific process steps|
|YYYY-MM-DD|Metadata|Added new metadata fields to classify documents by technical level|Responses better adapted to user's technical profile|
|YYYY-MM-DD|Cross-references|Implemented cross-references between related documents|More complete responses that integrate multiple knowledge aspects|


(Ref: RAG System Learning Evolution, ID system_learning_evolution_001)


## Emerging Patterns and Query Trends


### Frequently Queried Topics


Query patterns that emerge from user question analysis, revealing high-interest areas.


|Period|Topic|Frequency|Possible Reason|
|---------|--------|------------|----------------|
|YYYY-MM|Delinquency recovery|High|Ongoing recovery campaigns|
|YYYY-MM|Affiliate tracking|Medium|Launch of new affiliate program|
|YYYY-MM|Plan migration|High|Ongoing product restructuring|


(Ref: RAG System Learning Evolution, ID system_learning_evolution_001)


### Identified Usage Patterns


Insights into how different user groups interact with the documentation and RAG system.


|User Group|Observed Pattern|Implication|
|-------------------|------------------|------------|
|Developers|Preference for direct SQL examples over conceptual explanations|Expand the library of reusable code examples|
|Business Analysts|Queries focused on metrics and KPIs|Add more dashboard examples and visualizations|
|Support Team|Specific queries about troubleshooting scenarios|Develop troubleshooting guides|


(Ref: RAG System Learning Evolution, ID system_learning_evolution_001)


## Future Improvement Roadmap


### Short Term (Next 3 months)


Planned improvements for immediate implementation based on feedback and already identified gaps.


- [ ] Create dedicated document for financial reconciliation processes
- [ ] Expand SQL query examples for cohort analysis
- [ ] Improve documentation on canceled subscription recovery scenarios
- [ ] Add specific glossary for financial metrics terms


(Ref: RAG System Learning Evolution, ID system_learning_evolution_001)


### Medium Term (3-6 months)


Larger initiatives requiring additional research or development.


- [ ] Develop complete section on CRM system integration
- [ ] Create interactive simulator for plan modeling and financial projections
- [ ] Implement process flow visualizations to complement textual descriptions
- [ ] Expand documentation on data migration strategies


(Ref: RAG System Learning Evolution, ID system_learning_evolution_001)


### Long Term (6+ months)


Strategic vision for continuous knowledge evolution.


- [ ] Develop automated testing framework to validate RAG response accuracy
- [ ] Create documentation versions adapted to different user profiles
- [ ] Implement direct user feedback system within the RAG interface
- [ ] Expand to cover third-party ecosystem integrations


(Ref: RAG System Learning Evolution, ID system_learning_evolution_001)


## Conclusion and Ongoing Reflections


This document is intentionally evolutionary and will be continuously updated as the RAG system and knowledge base mature. The goal is not only to record changes but also to identify meta-cognitive patterns about how knowledge is best structured, accessed, and applied in this specific domain.


Lessons learned here will inform not only improvements to the current documentation but will also establish best practices for future documentation projects and RAG systems.
